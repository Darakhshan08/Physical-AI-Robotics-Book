# Environment Setup

A robust development environment is crucial for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This chapter guides you through setting up a comprehensive environment on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, including ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Python dependencies, and VS Code.

## 1. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Installation

We assume you have a fresh installation of **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**. If not, please follow the official Ubuntu installation guide for your system. Ensure you allocate sufficient disk space (at least 50GB) and RAM (16GB recommended, 8GB minimum).

## 2. ROS 2 Humble Installation

ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill is the Long Term Support (LTS) release compatible with Ubuntu 22.04.

```bash
# Set locale
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Setup Sources
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

# Install ROS 2 packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

# Environment setup
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 3. Gazebo Harmonic Setup

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robot simulator. We will use Gazebo Harmonic, which is the default for ROS 2 Humble.

```bash
# Install Gazebo Harmonic
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs

# Verify installation (optional)
gazebo --version
```

## 4. NVIDIA Isaac Sim (Omniverse) Installation

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool. It requires a powerful NVIDIA GPU.

1.  **System Requirements**: Ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU (RTX 30-series or newer recommended) and NVIDIA drivers installed.
2.  **Download Omniverse Launcher**: Visit the [NVIDIA Omniverse website](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse-platform) and download the Omniverse Launcher for Linux.
3.  **Install Isaac Sim**:
    *   Open the Omniverse Launcher.
    *   Go to the "Exchange" tab and search for "Isaac Sim".
    *   Click "Install" and follow the on-screen instructions.
    *   Ensure to install the Isaac Sim ROS 2 Bridge extension.

## 5. Python venv and Dependencies

It's good practice to use Python virtual environments for project-specific dependencies.

```bash
# Install pip and venv if not already present
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/physical_ai_venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/physical_ai_venv/bin/activate

# Install common Python packages
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy transforms3d modern_robotics
```

Remember to activate your virtual environment in each new terminal session where you plan to run Python code for the book.

## 6. VS Code Configuration

Visual Studio Code is a popular IDE for ROS 2 and Python development.

1.  **Install VS Code**: Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Install Extensions**: Open VS Code and install the following extensions:
    *   **Python**: (Microsoft) - For Python language support, debugging.
    *   **ROS**: (Microsoft) - For ROS message/service definitions, launch file integration.
    *   **C/C++**: (Microsoft) - For C++ development (if exploring `rclcpp`).
    *   **YAML**: (Red Hat) - For YAML file syntax highlighting and validation.
    *   **Markdown All in One**: (Yuya Watanabe) - For enhanced Markdown editing.

## 7. Verification Commands

After setup, verify your environment:

```bash
# Verify ROS 2 installation
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

# In a new terminal:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

# Verify Python virtual environment
source ~/physical_ai_venv/bin/activate
pip list

# Verify Gazebo (optional)
gazebo
```
You should see the talker and listener nodes communicating, your Python packages listed, and the Gazebo GUI launching.
