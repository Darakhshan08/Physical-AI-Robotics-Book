# What is Physical AI?

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, distinguishing it from traditional digital AI.

## Digital AI vs Embodied AI Differences

Digital AI primarily operates in virtual environments, processing data and making decisions based on abstract representations. Embodied AI, or Physical AI, focuses on intelligent systems that interact with the real world through a physical body.

## Physical AI Definition and Core Concepts

Physical AI involves AI systems that perceive, reason, and act within a physical environment. Key concepts include:
- **Perception**: Using sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) to understand the physical world.
- **Cognition**: Processing sensory data, learning, planning, and making decisions.
- **Action**: Executing physical movements through actuators (motors, grippers).
- **Embodiment**: The physical body of the AI, allowing interaction with the environment.
- **Understanding Physics**: AI systems that grasp real-world physics for robust and safe operation.

## Real-World Applications

Physical AI is driving innovation across various sectors:
- **Manufacturing**: Collaborative robots, autonomous material handling.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, assistive robots, prosthetics.
- **Logistics**: Autonomous delivery robots, warehouse automation.
- **Exploration**: Robots for hazardous environments (space, deep sea).
- **Home**: Domestic robots, assistive devices.

## Why Robots Need to Understand Physics

For a robot to operate effectively and safely in the real world, it must have an inherent understanding of physical laws. This includes:
- **Interaction with Objects**: Grasping, manipulating, pushing objects without breaking them or causing damage.
- **Navigation**: Avoiding collisions, maintaining balance, adapting to uneven terrain.
- **Safety**: Ensuring movements do not endanger humans or damage the environment.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing movements for energy consumption and task completion.

By understanding physics, robots can predict outcomes of their actions, adapt to unforeseen circumstances, and perform complex tasks with greater autonomy and reliability.
