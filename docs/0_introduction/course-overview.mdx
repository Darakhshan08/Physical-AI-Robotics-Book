## Hardware Requirements

To follow along with the practical aspects of this book, we recommend hardware setups across different tiers. Simulation is often the starting point, but physical hardware allows for invaluable real-world experience.

### Hardware Tier 1: Workstation (High Performance for Simulation & Development)

This tier provides the computing power necessary for smooth simulation, AI model training, and efficient development.

| Component         | Recommendation                               | Estimated Cost |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **CPU**           | Intel i7/Ryzen 7 (10th Gen+ / 3000 Series+)  | $300 - $500    |
| **GPU**           | NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti+ (12GB VRAM+)             | $800 - $1200   |
| **RAM**           | 64GB DDR4/DDR5                               | $150 - $300    |
