  "description": "While Gazebo is an excellent general-purpose simulator, Unity offers superior visual fidelity and advanced rendering capabilities, making it ideal for simulating environments where appearance matters, such as for human-robot interaction or computer vision tasks that benefit from photorealistic scenes. Unity's rich game development ecosystem can be leveraged for advanced robotic simulations.",
